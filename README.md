# Data-Visualization
I had done this course in order to learn the basics of Data Visualization, data analytics in Python using pycharm, you can also use jupyter notebook. You can find this course on Udemy
https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-data-analytics-complete-bootcamp-by-takenmind/

Use either one of the IDE's (use Juypter)
https://jupyter.org/
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Using Jupyter Notebook online is easy and there is a less stress on your machine.

Happy Learning :)
